The ACCurate Syncer does not collect, store, or transmit user data.

All extension logic runs locally in your browser. No analytics, tracking, or third-party telemetry is included.

The extension stores one local preference using `chrome.storage.local`:

- `delaySeconds` - your preferred target delay value
